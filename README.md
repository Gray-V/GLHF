## GLHF (Good Language Have Functions)

GLHF is a language not only for game developers, but also by game developers. Designed to be both powerful and user-friendly, GLHF targets the specific needs of game development. The syntax of this language features intuitive keywords that lower the difficulty of creating games, making it accessible to those new to programming while maintaining high skill ceiling. The language uses whitespace-sensitive programming for its structure to enhance readability and maintainability. Though it is not a code golfing language, GLHF understands the large ammount of code that gets put into gaming projects and as such aims to squash repetitive coding practices by containing libraries that are optimized for game development, mainly focusing on physics, and user input.
